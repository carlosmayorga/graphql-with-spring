# :snowflake: graphql-with-spring
A basic implementation of Graphql with Spring using .graphqls file for Schema and GraphQLQueryResolver 

- To use de `UI` interface to test the query: `http://localhost:8080/testing`
- To consume the query directly to the spring microservice use the `endpoint` :point_right: `http://localhost:8080/spring-graphql-demo`
- You can use Postman, but its more easy to use a client that shows you the Schemas like Altair Extension : `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/altair-graphql-client/flnheeellpciglgpaodhkhmapeljopja/related?hl=en-US`
